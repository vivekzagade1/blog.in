<h1>
	RESTful API in a Nutshell
</h1>

<p>
	I remember the first day when I was asked the question "Do you know what are RESTful API?".
	I didnt know a darn thing about it. In fact that was just the fifth or the sixth time, I'd heard those words. RESTful API have been an integral part of my day since then. I must admit the first few lessons I got from a Youtube video were pretty confusing when he said," Designing HTTP and RESTful APIs can be tricky as there is no official and enforced standard." Well I do think now that there are many ways of implementing an API but some of them have proven in practice and are widely adopted. Here is my understanding of best practices for building HTTP and RESTful APIs.
	The contents of thou shall be the exact chronology of the way I was taught, as in:
	1. URL structure
	2. HTTP methods
	3. Creating and updating resources
	4. Designing relationships
	5. Payload formats
	6. Pagination
	7. Versioning and definitely many more.

<h2>
	<br>GET -> /profiles/{}</br>
	<br>PUT -> /profiles/{51}</br>
	<br>POST -> /profiles</br>
	<br>DELETE -> profiles/{21}</br>
</h2>	

<p>
	Use URLs as in the above mentioned "/profile/..." to specify the resources you want to work with. Using the HTTP methods to specify what to do with this resource. With the four basic HTTP methods GET, POST, PUT,and DELETE you can provide CRUD functionality (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and beyond.(CRUD was another word that I thought was ver cool)
	Update: PATCH is another HTTP method I learnt about, which I did not use in my project. 
	These keywords were the start of the journey, I was about to go on. 
	URLs were specified in a such a way that "profile" wasn't used because it is a singular noun. Instead "profiles" as in to shown the collections of resources that were to be fetched by the beneficiary. 
	Note: Don't mix up the singular and plural forms, if not followed can be confusing.

	Directly on to the these topics might sound a little too excruciating. Lets start from the more basic definition.
	RESTful API: Internet sources say "REST is acronym for REpresentational State Transfer. It is architectural style for distributed hypermedia systems and was first presented by Roy Fielding in 2000 in his famous dissertation."
	In simple words "set of constraints to be used for creating Web services."
	Now to simplify some more. You use RESTful API to get information or "resources" from a certain server mapped to URL through hard-coded URL string or using various query-form verbal entities to get certain concentrated form of resource.
	Now, there are a few concepts/principle when it comes to understanding a this sophasticated piece of technology:
</p>

<h2>
	1. Client-Server:
</h2>
<p>
	Breaking down storage of resources and user beneficiary we improve the portability of the user interface across multiple platforms and improve scalability by simplifying the server components.
</p> 
<h2>
	2. Stateless:	
</h2>
<p>
	The request from client must contain all the necessary information to be able to understand the request.	
</p>
<h2>
	3. Hierarchical layers:	
</h2> 
<p>
	Structured layers of resouces inaccordance with the meta-data is positive that needs to be in our favour.	
</p>
<h2>
	4. Uniform interfaces:	
</h2>
<p>
	Every action and every reaction in this world has a meta-meaning that has interlinked connections to the other parts of the project.	
</p>
<h2>
	5. Cache:	
</h2>
<p>
	When a certain part of the request of a part of the response can be saved up to use for further operations is something that needs tio kept in mind.	
</p>
<h2>
 	Resource:
</h2>
<p>
	"Any information that can be named can be a resource: a document or image, a temporal service, a collection of other resources, a non-virtual object (e.g. a person), and so on. "
	REST maps all the resources to a specific identfier which is then used in component interation. A representation consists of data, metadata describing the data and hypermedia links which can help the clients in transition to the next desired state.
</p>
<h2>
	Resource Methods:	
</h2>
<p>
	Another important thing associated with REST is resource methods to be used to perform the desired transition.
</p>

<h2>GET /employees</h2>
<p>
	<br>GET /employees?state=external</br>
	<br>POST /employees</br>
	<br>PUT /employees/56</br>
	Use URLs to specify the resources you want to work with. Use the HTTP methods to specify what to do with this resource. With the five HTTP methods GET, POST, PUT, PATCH and DELETE you can provide CRUD functionality (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and beyond.

	<br>Read: Use GET for reading resources.</br>
	<br>Create: Use POST or PUT for creating new resources.</br>
	<br>Update: Use PUT and PATCH for updating existing resources.</br>
	<br>Delete: Use DELETE for deleting existing resources.</br>
</p>
<h2>
	POST on the Resource URL to Create a New Resource
</h2>
<p>
	The client sends a POST request to the resource collection URL /employees. The HTTP body contains the attributes of the new resource “Paul”.
	The RESTful web service generates an ID for the new employee, creates the employee in its internal model and sends a response to the client. This response contains the status code 201 (Created) and a Location HTTP header that indicates the URL under which the created resource is accessible.
</p>

<h2>
	PUT for Updating a Resource
</h2>
<p>
	The client sends a PUT request to the single resource URL /employee/21. The HTTP body of the PUT request contains all fields of the employee and every field will be updated on the server-side.
	The REST service updates the name and status of the employee with the ID 21 and confirms the changes with the HTTP status code 200.
</p>
<h2>
	Use HTTP Status Codes
</h2>
<p>
	<br>2xx – success – everything worked fine.</br>
	<br>4xx – client error – if the client did something wrong (e.g. the client sends an invalid request or he is not authorized)</br>
	<br>5xx – server error – failures on the server-side (errors while trying to process the request like database failures, dependend services are not available, programming errors or states that should not occur)</br>
</p>
<h2>
	Provide Links for Navigating through your API (HATEOAS)
</h2>
<p>
	Ideally, you don’t let your clients construct URLs for using your REST API. Let’s consider an example. It’s better to provide links in your response which the client can follow.If the client exclusively relies on the links to get the salary statement, he won’t break if you change your API, since the client will always get a valid URL (as long as you update the link in case of URL changes). Another benefit is that your API becomes more self-descriptive and the clients don’t have to look up the documentation that often.
</p>

<h2>Ensure Evolvability of the API</h2>
<h3>Avoid Breaking Changes</h3>
Ideally, REST APIs (as every API) should be stable. Basically, breaking changes (like changing the whole payload format or the URL scheme) should not happen. But how can we still evolve our API without breaking the clients?
<p>
<br>1.Make backward-compatible changes. Adding fields is no problem (as long as the clients are tolerant).</br>
<br>2.Duplication and Deprecation. In order to change an existing field (rename or change structure), you can add the new one next to the old field and deprecated the old one in the documentation. After a while, you can remove the old field.</br>
<br>3.Utilize Hypermedia and HATEOAS. As long as the API client uses the links in the response to navigate through the API (and doesn’t craft the URLs manually), you can safely change the URLs without breaking the clients.</br>
<br>4.Create new resources with new names. If new business requirements lead to a completely new domain model and workflows, you can create new resources. That’s often quite intuitive as the domain model has a new name anyway (derived from the business name). Example: A rental service now also rents bikes and segways. So the old concept car with the resource /cars doesn’t cut it anymore. A new domain model vehicle with a new resource /vehicles is introduced. It’s provided along with the old /cars resource.</br>
<br>5.Keep Business Logic on the Server-Side</br>
<br>6.Don’t let your service become a dump data access layer which provides CRUD functionality by directly exposing your database model (low-level API). This creates high coupling.</br>
</p>
